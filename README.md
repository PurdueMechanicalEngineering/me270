ME 270 - Basic Mechanics I (Statics)

This page contains several examples related to statics that seek to develop the computational capabilities of undergraduate mechanical engineering students.
The examples are developed using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebooks written in [Python](https://www.python.org).

## Examples

+ [Solving linear systems in Python](./solving_linear_systems.ipynb).

+ [Defining a Python function that calculates cross products](./cross_products_and_python_functions.ipynb).

+ [Making Simple Plots](./making_simple_plots.ipynb).

## Installation of Required Software for Viewing the Notebookes

Find and download the right version of 
[Anaconda for Python 2.7](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) from Continuum Analytics.
This package contains most of the software we are going to need.
Please use Python 2.7 - **not Python 3.0**.

## Running the notebooks

Follow the instructions [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html) to see how you can run the notebooks on different operating systems.
Of course, first you need to download them.
If you are familiar with git, you should be fine.
Otherwise, just download the repository as a zip file and unzip it.
(It is probably a good idea to familiarize yourself with git if you do an software development!
[This is an excellent guide.](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).)
